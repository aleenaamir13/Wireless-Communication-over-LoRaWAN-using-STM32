# Wireless-Communication-over-LoRaWAN-using-STM32
This project proposes a LoRaWAN-based wireless communication system using the PIC18 microcontroller for data collection and transmission. Leveraging LoRaWANâ€™s long-range and low-power features, it overcomes limitations of traditional wireless methods, enabling sensors, gateways, and cloud integration for real-time environmental monitoring.

# Features
STM32 with built-in LoRa module
Sends sensor data to TTN cloud
Long-range, low-power communication
Real-time monitoring on TTN dashboard
Supports multiple sensor nodes

# Hardware
STM32 Microcontroller (with built-in LoRa)
Sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.)
LoRaWAN Gateway
Power supply

# Software & Tools
STM32 firmware for sensor data transmission
Tera Term for flashing/programming STM32
TTN Console for monitoring data

# Setup
Connect sensors to STM32.
Use Tera Term to flash the STM32 firmware.
Register the device and gateway on TTN.
View sensor data on TTN console.

# Usage
Power on STM32 node and TTN gateway.
STM32 sends data via LoRaWAN to TTN.
Monitor live data on TTN dashboard.
