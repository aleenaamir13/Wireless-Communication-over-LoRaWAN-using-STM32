# Wireless-Communication-over-LoRaWAN-using-STM32
This project proposes a LoRaWAN-based wireless communication system using the PIC18 microcontroller for data collection and transmission. Leveraging LoRaWANâ€™s long-range and low-power features, it overcomes limitations of traditional wireless methods, enabling sensors, gateways, and cloud integration for real-time environmental monitoring.
